# USES of PEMF

## Delayed- and non-union fractures

An old fracture with nonunion of the fracture fragments. In 1974 it was demonstrated that a pulsed magnetic field applied across the site of a bone fracture can accelerate the healing process (Bassett et al., 1974). The mechanism of osteogenesis is not clear; however, the use of PEMF therapy as an adjuvant therapy for delayed- and non-union fractures was supported by empirical evidence collected through clinical studies.\[7\]\[8\] While PEMF therapy may offer some benefit in the treatment of fractures, the evidence is inconclusive and is insufficient to inform current clinical practice.\[9\] Although electricity's potential to aid bone healing was reported as early as 1841, it was not until the mid-1950s that scientists seriously studied the subject. Fukada's and Yasuda's discovery of the electric potential of bone provided evidence of electricity's effect in promoting osteogenesis (bone growth), particularly in long bone non-unions.\[10\] During the 1970s, Bassett and his team introduced a new approach for the treatment of delayed fractures, a technique that employed a very specific biphasic low frequency signal \[11\]\[12\]\[13\]\[14\] to be applied for non-union/delayed fractures. The use of electrical stimulation in the lumbosacral region was first attempted by Alan Dwyer of Australia.

Since that time, electrical stimulation has been shown to significantly increase the probability of bony arthrodesis in spinal fusions.

## Depression

Transcranial magnetic stimulation is FDA approved since 2011 for use on patients that failed to respond to antidepressants.\[17\] Weak magnetic stimulation of the brain is often called transcranial pulsed electromagnetic field (tPEMF) therapy.\[18\] Early hints of efficacy of tPEMF as antidepressant came from observations that bipolar patients improved their mood after a magnetic resonance spectrogram, an approach which has been labeled LFMS.\[19\] Studies in rodents have shown behavioural effects of tPEMF that are consistent with antidepressant effects.\[20\]\[21\]\[22\] In humans, the treatment is usually given once or twice daily for two or more weeks.\[18\]
